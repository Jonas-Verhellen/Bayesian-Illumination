GB-BI Documentation
====================

**Graph-Based Bayesian Illumination (GB-BI)** is an open-source software library that aims to make state-of-the-art, quality-diversity optimisation techniques infused with Bayesian optimisation easily accessible to scientific experts in medicinal chemistry and cheminformatics. We provide a modular codebase, novel benchmarks, and extensive documentation. Details on the theoretical foundation and the general motivation behind this approach can be found in the `preprint (ChemrXiv 2024) <https://arxiv.org/>`_.

Overview
==========

Despite a surge of deep learning papers focused on generative models for small molecules, it remains difficult for these models to out-compete more traditional, rule-based approaches such as genetic algorithms. While comparatively efficient, genetic algorithms have two main drawbacks: susceptibility to stagnation (due to diversity collapse in the evolutionary population) and the lack of exploitation of the information encoded in the fitness values of the different molecules generated by the algorithm throughout its optimisation procedure.

**Bayesian Illumination** solves both of these issues by combining the stepping-stone properties of quality-diversity methods (to escape stagnation) with the sampling efficiency of Bayesian optimisation to create a novel generative model that vastly outperforms both deep learning models and genetic algorithms. Random selection from the physicochemical archive, mutations, and crossovers initiate exploration of the search space. Structural filtering further refines molecule selection.

The main novelty of Bayesian illumination compared to a previous quality diversity method for small molecule optimisation is the use of surrogate fitness and acquisition function calculations to inform the selection of a single molecule to be compared in direct evolutionary competition with the current occupant of the niche. This algorithm is applied iteratively, in batches known as generations, until a predetermined fitness function budget is exhausted or the algorithm has converged.
